# Customize Preference Center

It is possible to customize the personal preference center/unsubscribe page and edit text labels, format and apply themes using the landing page builder.

## Creating a Preference Center Page

When creating/editing a landing page, there is a toggle button labeled *Is preference center*, toggling this button shows/hides the preference center slots in the builder

These slots in the builder are used to customize the page:

Optionally, you can use tokens to insert the different slots. Keep in mind that if you use tokens, you lose the ability to customize the labels and styles of the slots because it uses the default ones.

To finish, don't forget to include a "save preferences" button, otherwise the preferences can't be saved:

Save the page and the preference center landing page is ready.

Now in the landing pages list, the icon with the little cog indicates that the page is a preference center one.

When viewing a preference center page, there is a header indicating its purpose and the page URL is not available, only the preview URL.

## Setting Preference Center Pages in Emails

When creating or editing an email, you can select the Preference Center Page from the list as shown:

Keep in mind that your mail must use the same langugage as the preference center landing page - if not, default preference center will be shown.

Now when the email is sent, all recipients will be able to click on the Unsubscribe link and the new preference center page will be displayed.

If no Preference Center page is selected in an email, the default page is displayed.
